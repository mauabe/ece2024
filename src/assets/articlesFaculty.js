Major research efforts are ongoing for the synthesis and design of advanced materials, such as two-­dimensional semiconductors, topological insulators, and ­magnetic oxides — both their fundamental properties and their applications to ultra-scaled logic and memory devices. We also have extensive activities in the ­design and fabrication of ultra-scaled devices on both silicon and compound semiconductors, such as power and RF transistors, spin-based switches and memory elements, tunnel FETs, and other novel devices that are ­suitable for applications that go beyond conventional scaling. ­Another major thrust is the development of ­neuromorphic (i.e., brain-­inspired) devices and nanosystems for computation and ­information processing. Nanoelectronic devices are under ­investigation for use as sensors for compact biomedical sensing tools. This area also includes the development of Micro- and Nano-Electromechanical Systems (MEMS and NEMS). In ­addition, we investigate new methods of interconnecting ­heterogeneous devices for a more holistic interpretation of Moore’s law. Many of these research activities take place in ­collaboration with other ­research groups, both within and ­outside ECE, on circuit/system/device co-design and ­co-­optimization. The ­nanoelectronics ­research in the department is supported by ­advanced commercial simulation tools for device analysis, a state-of-the-art nano-fabrication ­facility, and device characterization equipment with capability from DC to over 100GHz.</p></div></div><div class="full"><div class="prof-pics"><div><img class="fac" src="/img/Elaheh-Ahmadi.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty Elaheh Ahmadi"></div><div><img class="fac" src="/img/Clarice_D_Aiello.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty Clarice Aiello"></div><div><img class="fac" src="/img/candler2.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty Rob Candler"></div><div><img class="fac" src="/img/SergioCarbajo.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty Sergio Carbajo"></div><div><img class="fac" src="/img/emaminejad6.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty Sam Emaminejad"></div><div><img class="fac" src="/img/Mona-Jarrahi.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty Mona Jarrahi"></div><div><img class="fac" src="/img/DwightStreit.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty Dweit Streit"></div><div><img class="fac" src="/img/wang.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty Kang Wang"></div><div><img class="fac" src="/img/CheeWeiWong3.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty Chee Wei Wong"></div><div><img class="fac" src="/img/Woo.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty Jason Woo"></div></div><div class="page-caption faculty-caption"><b>Faculty:</b> Elaheh Ahmadi, Clarice Aiello, Robert Candler, Sergio Carbajo, Sam Emaminejad, Mona Jarrahi, Dwight Streit, Kang Wang, Chee Wei Wong, Jason C.

For example, nearly all of the information on the internet is transported by encoding it onto signals of infrared light carried on optical fibers. Many unknown materials can be identified by studying how light interacts with them (i.e., by scattering, absorbing, phase shifting, or polarizing some incident photons). The name “photonics” emphasizes the importance of quantum mechanical properties of light and its interaction with matter. Many topics in photonics research involve development and/or use of lasers. Our research program encompasses topics such as how light interacts both with matter on the nanoscale and in plasmas, as well as new ways to generate, detect, and control light in underdeveloped spectral regions. Applications under investigation include the diverse topics of solar energy generation, lensless microscopy for cell-phone based telemedicine, high energy laser wakefield particle accelerators, ultra-high frame rate imaging, silicon photonics, biomedical imaging, and use of stabilized lasers for ultra-high precision measurements — just to name a few.</p></div></div><div class="full"><div class="prof-pics"><div><img class="fac" src="/img/Arisaka_Katsushi.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty  Arisaka_Katsushi"></div><div><img class="fac" src="/img/SergioCarbajo.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty  Sergio Carbajo"></div><div><img class="fac" src="/img/Jia-Ming-Liu.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty  Jia-Ming-Liu"></div><div><img class="fac" src="/img/Ozcan_Aydogan.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty Ozcan"></div><div><img class="fac" src="/img/williams.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty  Ben Williams"></div><div><img class="fac" src="/img/fetterman.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty Harold Fetterman"></div><div><img class="fac" src="/img/PATEL-emeritus.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty Patel"></div><div><img class="fac" src="/img/stafsudd.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty  Stafsudd"></div></div><div class="page-caption faculty-caption"><b>Faculty:</b>Katsushi Arisaka, Sergio Carbajo, Jia-Ming Liu, Aydogan Ozcan, Benjamin Williams (pictured).

Our ­signal ­processing research targets the inference, visualization,representation, and learning of a broad spectrum of signals ­related to media (including speech, video and ­social media), ­sensors (for medical, military, space, process ­control or environmental applications), communications and control networks (wireless and utility ­networks), and adaptive arrays (such as acoustic and radar). This applies to problems ranging in scale ­from the microscopic to Big Data. ­Research ­contributes to ­disciplines ­descended from both Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences roots, such as ­machine learning, statistical ­signal ­processing,­ ­stochastic modeling, graphical ­models, ­information theory, adaptation and learning ­algorithms, ­inference over networks, distributed ­signal processing, data ­analysis and ­distributed ­optimization.</p></div></div><div class="full"> <div class="prof-pics"> <div><img class="fac" src="/img/AbeerAlwan-profile.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty AlwanAbeer"></div><div><img class="fac" src="/img/Corey-W-Arnold.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty Corey W.
