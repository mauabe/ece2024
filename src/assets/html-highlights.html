<p style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter"> Mona </span> Jarrahi, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department professor, and Nezih Tolga Yardimci, a post-doctoral scholar in the department, have received an Innovation in Regulatory Science Award from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund. The award provides up to $500,000 over five years to aid in the developing of new methodologies in regulatory science. The program’s goal is to provide researchers with the funding necessary to develop new tools that will aid regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p> Professor Jarrahi’s research interests include terahertz imaging and spectroscopy, microwave photonics and ultrafast electro-optics. Her scientific achievements have been recognized by several awards including the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers; Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel Award; Moore Inventor Fellowship; Kavli Fellowship; Popular Mechanics Breakthrough Award; Okawa Research Award; IEEE Early Career Award in Nanotechnology; Outstanding Young Engineer Award from the IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society; Booker Fellowship; Lot Shafai Mid-Career Distinguished Achievement Award; NSF Early Career Award; Young Investigator Awards from ONR, ARO, and DARPA. Jarrahi is a Fellow Member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a Fellow Member of the Optical Society of America (OSA), and a Fellow Member of the International Society of Optical Engineers (SPIE).</p>
<p> Tolga Yardimci received his doctorate in electrical engineering from UCLA in 2017. He was a member of the Terahertz Electronics Laboratory during his graduate studies, where Jarrahi is principal investigator. For his doctoral studies, he conducted research on large area plasmonic nanoantenna arrays for high-power terahertz generation and high-sensitivity terahertz detection, a technology that is now commercialized for high-performance terahertz imaging and spectroscopy systems. Yardimci is the recipient of the UCLA Innovation Fund, Henry Samueli Fellowship, SPIE Scholarship in Optics and Photonics and a Best Paper Award at the International Conference of International Society of Infrared, Millimeter and Terahertz Waves.  </p>
<p> The Burroughs Wellcome Fund serves and strengthens society by nurturing a diverse group of leaders in biomedical sciences to improve human health through education and powering discovery in frontiers of greatest need. Its financial support is channeled primarily through competitive peer-reviewed award programs. The Burroughs Wellcome Fund was founded in 1955 as the corporate foundation of the pharmaceutical firm Burroughs Wellcome Co. In 1993, it became fully independent from the company, which was acquired by Glaxo in 1995. BWF has no affiliation with any corporation.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter"> Our </span> environments are getting smarter. Advances in sensors, actuators, and communication have made the vision of ambient intelligence increasingly achievable. We have seen an increasing number of smarts around us such as voice assistants, service robots, UAVs, autonomous vehicles, and a broader array of connective objects in IoT. Professor Yang Zhang creates enabling technologies to make ambient intelligence more powerful in facilitating the future of work, healthcare, and education. He also researches human-centered design frameworks to make ambient intelligence and the environments they reside in equally accessible to all and can be developed by anyone. Professor Zhang is currently directing the Human-Centered Computing & Intelligent Sensing Lab (HiLab) at UCLA ECE. <span className="text-italic">https://www.hilab.dev</span></p>

<h3>Pillar 1: Create more powerful ambient intelligence</h3>
<p>HiLab creates sensing technologies to extend the capabilities of ambient intelligence. Such technologies improve the communication bandwidth between ambient intelligence by prepping everyday objects for interactivity -- intelligent walls that sense human poses, cameras that turn surfaces into high-precision touchscreens. Additionally, HiLab develops novel sensors that monitor events and user activities for environmental and personal informatics, such as cameras that sense vibrations to recognize building- and city-scale activities. Overall, this research pillar enables ambient intelligence to acquire knowledge from people either explicitly (i.e., interaction) or implicitly (i.e., event and activity recognition) in a practical manner.</p>

<h3>Pillar 2: Use ambient intelligence to make the physical world accessible to all</h3>
<p>Ambient intelligence also opens new opportunities for making the physical world equally accessible to all. Specifically, HiLab develops systems that can digitize the physical world for accessibility applications, including virtual and augmented reality techniques that allow people with disabilities to better navigate through a world full of barriers and inaccessible information. HiLab also creates intelligent sensing and actuation systems that can be easily deployed by people with motor impairments (e.g., users of wheelchairs) for independent living and improved life qualities.</p>

<h3>Pillar 3: Lower the barrier for everyone to create ambient intelligence</h3>
<p>Finally, HiLab aims to empower everyone to create ambient intelligence. By improving their environments, people improve their lives (e.g., switching for a brighter lightbulb). We believe that people should be able to create ambient intelligence as easily as switching a lightbulb. Besides sponsoring the community with toolkits of existing research, HiLab also seeks general design frameworks that can be easily adopted by anyone for any application. Ongoing research in this pillar includes 1) creating open-source sensor toolkits, 2) developing frameworks for developers to create human-centered energy-constrained systems, and 3) using augmented and virtual reality to facilitate developing and debugging of smart environments.</p>
