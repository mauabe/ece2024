He aims to train AI systems to learn high-level knowledge through the observation of human experts performing various tasks, such as examining tissue slides for evidence of tumors. Instead of providing the AI with slides that are labeled “tumor” or “no tumor” in the way that much current machine learning is done, Chen’s research will allow the AI to track how an experienced pathologist reviews biopsy slides and relay details, including their eye movements and how they pan or zoom into the slide. The AI can then analyze slides with its own highly trained “eye.” </p><p> Chen has received multiple awards for researchers early in their careers.

The algorithm enhances the visibility and color of both still images and videos at record speed. Led by Bahram Jalali, distinguished professor emeritus of electrical and computer engineering as well as bioengineering, the team has established a new paradigm for algorithm design where laws of physics provide a blueprint for crafting algorithms.</p><p>  The team published this week its aptly named approach “VEViD,” which stands for Vision Enhancement via Virtual-diffraction and coherent Detection, in the optics journal, eLight. Callen MacPhee, a UCLA electrical engineering graduate student pursuing a master’s degree, is the co-author. The new methodology is in sharp contrast to both classical algorithms based on empirical hand-crafted rules and modern artificial intelligence algorithms that rely on a massive amount of computations involving millions of parameters. “Our new algorithm builds on more than two decades of research in optical physics in our laboratory and has direct applications in augmented reality, night-time driving, biology, and space exploration,” Jalali said. “Comparison of VEViD with leading neural network algorithms shows comparable or better image quality but with one to two orders of magnitude faster-processing speed.”</p><p> The physics-inspired approach leads to a surprisingly simple and computationally efficient algorithm with exceptional image quality and processing speed. The algorithm can enhance 4K-resolution videos at more than 200 frames per second, much faster than other algorithms with similar image quality.</p><p> Under low-light conditions such as at night time, digital images suffer from low contrast and loss of information. VEViD is designed to improve these qualities for two purposes: increased visual quality for human perception and increased object-detection accuracy using machine learning. The technology has applications in security cameras, autonomous vehicles, robots, vision assistance for the elderly and live cell tracking for drug development.</p><p>  The team has successfully demonstrated VEViD’s ability to perform a color enhancement and managed to pair the algorithm with a neural network trained to detect objects. “VEViD can act as a pair of glasses for computer vision algorithms trained on daylight scenes — allowing them to see and detect objects in the dark,” MacPhee said. “This makes those networks more robust while also saving training time and energy.”</p><p> The research was supported by grants from the Parker Center for Cancer Immunotherapy and the Office of Naval Research. The UCLA team will make its codes and data available on the publicly accessible GitHub repository.</p> '

The first-of-its-kind system builds on previous skin-sensing technologies developed by the researchers, and a paper describing the new technology has recently been published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS).</p><p>   One potential application of the technology is to embed the sensors in steering wheels of keyless cars to measure blood alcohol and drug levels.

To solve this problem, chipmakers decided to rotate the use of transistors, leaving certain areas unused at any given time, the so-called “dark silicon,” but that has created its own problem of inefficiency.  Now, UCLA electrical engineers have designed a new type of computer chip that takes advantage of the increasingly underutilized processing areas. The problem of inefficiency in dark silicon areas has cropped up over the past decade. While transistors have continued to get smaller, the chip’s power consumption has remained the same, leading to power shortages if all the transistors are in use simultaneously. To stay within the power limit, only transistors in certain areas are “turned on” at any one time. However, the in-use areas are usually occupied by energy-efficient yet inflexible hardware accelerator blocks designed to execute a growing number of hard-coded functions.</p><p>    Led by Dejan Markovic, the team has introduced a new energy-efficient chip design that maximizes the areas set aside for data-intensive processing while minimizing areas of dark silicon. Earlier this year, the UCLA researchers presented their study at the 2022 International Solid-States Circuits Conference. Theirs was the only paper authored by a group of university researchers, with industry representatives giving the rest of the presentations. “The key to our chip design is its network of multiple connecting layers over the core processing elements. This minimizes delays and maximizes the total area being used,” Markovic said. “Like a network of in-sync traffic lights, the smart network moves and manages data processing and computing applications efficiently across the entire network of billions of transistors.” </p><p>    According to the researchers, their network’s operation is driven by real-time usage statistics along with a switch box that controls which parts of the processing elements are in use, thereby maximizing energy efficiency. The design is also reconfigurable, so it can be tailored for specific applications.</p><p>    Titled “A 16nm 785GMACs/J 784-Core Digital Signal Processor Array with a Multilayer Switch Box Interconnect, Assembled as a 2×2 Dielet with 10μm-Pitch Inter-Dielet I/O for RuntimeMulti-Program Reconfiguration,” the paper is accessible at the IEEE Xplore Library. Other authors are UCLA graduate students Uneeb Rathore and Sumeet Singh Nagi, as well as Subramanian Iyer, distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering at UCLA Samueli and holder of the Charles P. Reames Endowed Chair in Electrical Engineering. </p>'

Similar to a pipe that enables liquid to flow through from one end to the other in both directions, standard optical materials and lenses allow light to travel both ways through devices such as a camera. A research team at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering lead by professors Aydogan Ozcan and Mona Jarrahi recently invented a new unidirectional material to break this paradigm in optical imaging. The researchers used artificial intelligence (AI) to structurally engineer materials with details at scales smaller than the wavelength of light. The result is an imager design through which imaging is only possible in one direction, while being blocked from the other. </p><p> Published in Science Advances, the paper titled “Unidirectional Imaging Using Deep Learning-Designed Materials” delineates the innovative optical imager design consisting of a series of transmissive optical layers through the spatial engineering of materials using deep learning. “This AI-driven engineering of the material leads to the formation of multiple structured, transparent layers that collectively modulate the optical waves with an asymmetric behavior in the forward and backward imaging directions,” said Aydogan Ozcan, holder of UCLA’s Volgenau Chair for Engineering Innovation. “The resulting unidirectional imager allows image formation from an input field of view to an output field of view, but not the other way around. The reverse path for image formation is blocked.”</p><p>  Even under broadband light composed of many wavelengths, the unidirectional imager can maintain its functionality despite being trained using a single illumination wavelength. This unidirectional imaging capability is also independent of light polarization and works under any orientation of light oscillations. In their experiments, the researchers successfully demonstrated the design’s efficacy on a 3D-printed multilayered imager by exposing it to terahertz radiation. The team also designed a separate imager that allowed a user to choose which direction the image should be blocked by selecting a specific wavelength. For example, at one wavelength, the image formation only works from left to right, while at a different wavelength, the reversed path is the only direction from which the image can be seen.</p><p>   This wavelength-multiplexed design enhances the unidirectional imager’s capability and flexibility, allowing it to function like a switchboard to control the transmission of information coded in light waves. Unidirectional imagers can operate at any part of the electromagnetic spectrum using different transmissive materials or substrates, and they are very thin — with a few tens of wavelengths in thickness, which, in the visible spectrum, would correspond to the thickness of a stamp. These unidirectional imagers could have a significant impact on various fields, including security, defense and telecommunications.</p><p>   Funded by the Office of Naval Research and Burroughs Wellcome Fund, the study was conducted in collaboration with professor Mona Jarrahi, holder of UCLA’s Northrop Grumman Endowed Chair. Both Jarrahi and Ozcan are members of the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA, with Ozcan serving as its associate director. Ozcan also holds faculty appointments in the Department of Bioengineering and the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Other authors of the paper are graduate students Jingxi Li, Tianyi Gan, Yifan Zhao, Bijie Bai, Che-Yung Shen and Songyu Sun — all members of Ozcan’s and Jarrahi’s research labs at UCLA.</p> '

UCLA CHIPS, which is housed at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering, will translate the new Heterogeneous Integration Roadmap into a blueprint that defines manufacturing requirements for U.S. semiconductor factories. The grant, one of the first awarded by NIST’s Advanced Manufacturing Technology Roadmap Program (MfgTech), will fund the project for 18 months.</p><p>“While the Heterogeneous Integration Roadmap (HIR) is application-focused, our work will translate this roadmap into a manufacturing infrastructure blueprint that starts at the basic materials used in advanced packaging and breaks down integrated processes into individual unit processes,” said Subramanian Iyer, a distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering who holds UCLA’s Charles P. Reames Endowed Chair and is the director of UCLA CHIPS. “Some of them will diverge from traditional silicon processes and include custom manufacturing tools and processes that address dies, wafers and panels. Our roadmap will also be customizable to work with many application-dependent variables.”.</p><p> Supported by microelectronics leaders, SEMI and UCLA CHIPS will first create a technology-neutral communications platform for peers across the supply chain, academics and industry experts. SEMI, a global industry association that unites the electronics manufacturing and design supply chain, will define a process for prioritizing and guiding critical areas of the HIR to standardization. UCLA will organize academically themed workshops and panels to ensure the roadmaps are scalable and extendable as new applications evolve and new processes are developed.</p><p>“SEMI and UCLA CHIPS look forward to leveraging our expertise in semiconductor and packaging roadmaps — from upstream innovations to downstream manufacturing processes and assembly and distribution — to develop the HIR and take the next step toward factory implementation,” said Melissa Grupen-Shemansky, SEMI’s chief technology officer and vice president of SEMI Technology Communities. “SEMI will also turn to its workforce development strategies to offer HIR technology training at all levels of education by focusing on transforming innovations into cost-effective, customizable large-scale manufacturing in the U.S.”</p> '
