    textCopy: ' <p style="text-indent:0"><span class="first-letter">I</span>nternet security and performance problems often persist invisibly. Operators hide services that later turn out vulnerable, networks sporadically balance load through egregiously-long routing paths, and attackers avoid the network monitors used to capture them. Protecting and improving the Internet\’s operations requires near-real-time visibility into how networks, and their users, function in practice. Yet, there exists no complete ground truth on how the Internet operates because service configurations, user patterns, and network architectures are diverse, distributed, and ephemeral. There do exist systems that collect data and models that predict operations, but they rely on simplified or unvalidated assumptions about networks, operators, and attackers, restricting their visibility. Consequently, performance troubles and security vulnerabilities exist undetected, allowing them to evolve into catastrophic outages and breaches.</p><p>My research group builds data collection systems that rigorously account for the Internet\s complexities to reveal in near-real time, previously-unseen critical operational challenges and threats. We investigate the complex behaviors of networks, attackers, and operators by using quantitative analysis, including non-parametric statistics, to validate and challenge community assumptions. </p><p> We build high-performance Internet scanning systems that learn from Internet service deployment patterns to provide the most accurate, global, and up-to-date view of different address spaces and network architectures of the Internet. We then use the data our systems collect to improve performance, defend against attackers, and develop empirical methodologies for future Internet analysis.</p><p>The operator, attacker, and network patterns that we have identified, along with our systems, have changed how researchers and industry search for performance faults and security threats on the Internet. Governments (e.g., US, UK) and companies (e.g., Hunt Intelligence, Peakhour, Censys) rely on our systems to proactively notify operators about vulnerabilities. Netflix is improving video delivery for over one million satellite users due to the global performance trends surfaced by our systems. As the Internet\s complexity continues to increase, building data-collecting systems that provide complete and real-time Internet visibility is critical to prevent the Internet\s largest performance and security failures from invisibly brewing.</p><p><span><b>Liz Izhikevich</b></span>is an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles.

    textCopy: '  <p style="text-indent:0"><span class="first-letter">E</span>ver since physicists identified the transformative potential of computers exploiting quantum effects in the 1980s, the field of quantum information science has revolutionized both our understanding of Nature and our belief of what is computationally possible. Quantum computers are now widely believed to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. However, the full scope of quantum computing’s power and the real-world applications where it can provide a meaningful “quantum advantage” remain key questions. At the forefront of this exploration is the intersection of quantum computation and physics, where novel algorithms could unlock groundbreaking capabilities in optimization, simulation, and machine learning.</p><p>My research group focuses on understanding and harnessing the capabilities of quantum computation to address fundamental and applied questions in computer science and physical systems. We aim to develop quantum algorithms that solve computationally hard problems, such as those in optimization, logistics, quantum chemistry, and materials science, in addition to studying the theoretical limitations of these methods. By bridging quantum information science, mathematical optimization, and statistical inference, our work seeks to uncover new applications of quantum algorithms and establish a solid theoretical foundation for their performance.</p><p>Currently, we are working on several exciting projects, including quantum optimization algorithms for hard combinatorial optimization problems, quantum simulations of many-body physics, and addressing computational-statistical gaps in high-dimensional data analysis. A key emphasis of our work is connecting theory with practice: we collaborate with partners in academia and industry (including Google, QuEra, Phasecraft, and BlueQubit) to implement quantum algorithms on near-term quantum hardware, such as superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and neutral atom platforms. These efforts aim to push the boundaries of computational feasibility and pave the way for demonstrating practical quantum advantages.</p><p><span>Leo Zhou  </span>  is an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles. He received his Ph.D. in Physics from Harvard University in 2021 under the guidance of Mikhail Lukin, after earning a B.Sc. in Physics and Mathematics at MIT in 2014. Before joining UCLA, he held a Burke Institute Prize Fellowship at Caltech and received the Outstanding Paper Award in 2022 at the 17th Conference on Theory of Quantum Computation. His research contributions include elucidating the advantages and limitations of quantum optimization algorithms and establishing foundational results in quantum complexity theory. He has collaborated closely with experimental groups to develop and test quantum applications on cutting-edge quantum devices. Through his research, he aims to deepen our understanding of quantum algorithms and their real-world impact while mentoring the next generation of quantum engineers and scientists.</p>'
