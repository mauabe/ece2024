    textCopy: ' <p style="text-indent:0"><span class="first-letter">I</span>nternet security and performance problems often persist invisibly. Operators hide services that later turn out vulnerable, networks sporadically balance load through egregiously-long routing paths, and attackers avoid the network monitors used to capture them. Protecting and improving the Internet's operations requires near-real-time visibility into how networks, and their users, function in practice. Yet, there exists no complete ground truth on how the Internet operates because service configurations, user patterns, and network architectures are diverse, distributed, and ephemeral. There do exist systems that collect data and models that predict operations, but they rely on simplified or unvalidated assumptions about networks, operators, and attackers, restricting their visibility. Consequently, performance troubles and security vulnerabilities exist undetected, allowing them to evolve into catastrophic outages and breaches.<p>My research group builds data collection systems that rigorously account for the Internet's complexities to reveal in near-real time previously-unseen critical operational challenges and threats. We investigate the complex behaviors of networks, attackers, and operators by using quantitative analysis, including non-parametric statistics, to validate and challenge community assumptions. We build high-performance Internet scanning systems that learn from Internet service deployment patterns to provide the most accurate, global, and up-to-date view of different address spaces and network architectures of the Internet. We then use the data our systems collect to improve performance, defend against attackers, and develop empirical methodologies for future Internet analysis.<p>The operator, attacker, and network patterns that we have identified, along with our systems, have changed how researchers and industry search for performance faults and security threats on the Internet. Governments (e.g., US, UK) and companies (e.g., Hunt Intelligence, Peakhour, Censys) rely on our systems to proactively notify operators about vulnerabilities. Netflix is improving video delivery for over one million satellite users due to the global performance trends surfaced by our systems. As the Internet's complexity continues to increase, building data-collecting systems that provide complete and real-time Internet visibility is critical to prevent the Internet's largest performance and security failures from invisibly brewing.<p><span>Liz Izhikevich</span>is an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles. Prior, Professor Izhikevich was a Ph.D. fellow in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University and a graduate of UC San Diego (BS '17, MS ’18). Her work has received ACM IMC's Community Contribution Award and has seen widespread adoption across industry and government. Recently, she was named a Forbes Science 30 under 30 honoree and an EECS Rising Star. '
