UCLA ECE continues to impact the greater electrical and computer engineering community with our education, service, and research efforts.</p><p>We welcomed three new faculty this past year. Prof. Liz Izhikevich, who obtained her degree from Stanford University, is a pioneer on network security through examining network traffic and characteristics using innovative “scanning” methods and algorithms. Prof. Di Luo, who came to us from University of Illinois Urbana-Champagne, works broadly in the use of computation in solving problems in quantum science. He uses machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to make modifications to AI algorithms and explores quantum algorithms for optimization. And, Prof. Leo Zhou, fresh from his post-doctoral research at CalTech, bridges information theory (statistical sampling theory), optimization, and theoretical physics and has been able to combine them to identify problems that highlights the computational advantage of quantum computing, and realization of these quantum applications in real physical systems.</p><p>We also welcomed back two of our faculty from their service (Intergovernmental Personnel Act) to the U.S. government. Prof. Jason Woo completed his four years as a Program Manager for DARPA’s Microsystems Technology Office and Prof. Subramanian Iyer completed one year as the Director of National Advanced Packaging and Manufacturing Program. Both of them were seminal in guiding the advancement of the semiconductor manufacturing and research of our nation.</p><p>Members of our UCLA community have been recognized by the engineering community at large. To highlight a few, Prof. Aydogan Ozcan, for his contributions in photonics, Prof. Lixia Zhang, for her contributions in computer networking, and Adj. Professor Dariush Divsalar, for his contribution at NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, were elected to the National Academy of Engineering, the highest honor in an engineer career. Assistant Professor Nader Sehatbakhsh received the National Science Foundation CAREER award for “Integrating Microarchitecture Simulation and Side-Channel Leakage Modeling for Safer Software”. For teaching, Associate Professor Jonathan Kao received Northrop Grumman Excellence in Teaching Award. Prof. Behzad Razavi was awarded funds to establish the Center for Education of Microchip Designers (CEMiD) by the National Center for the Advancement of Semiconductor Technology (NatCAST). Our students were also recognized. Professor Aydin Babakhani\'s student, Sidharth Thomas, received the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society (SSCS) Predoctoral Achievement Award. Haoxiang Ren and Fulian Hung who work with Prof. Subramanian Iyer and C.K. Ken Yang won the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship. And, our IEEE student group was recognized with IEEE Rising Star for Introductory Projects for their work on “Open Project Space” and for Advanced Project for “WRAP RF Design Systems”.</p><p>This report also highlights recent work funded by DARPA on Optimum Processing Technology Inside Memory Arrays (OPTIMA), led by Prof. Sudhakar Pamarti, using energy-efficient analog computing for neural net computation. Programs like this are just one example of the multitude of research efforts that amount to grant funding of over $35M in the past year in the department.</p><p>This annual report and our website reflect a change in how we organize our research that was initiated this past year. The new series of tracks better illustrate the collaborative and multi-disciplinary nature of ECE research and education engaged by our students and faculty. As my tenure as chairman comes to a close, I pen this final introductory message of an annual report and am pleased to be passing the chairman\’s duties to Prof. Benjamin Williams. The past five years have been a whirlwind and I am excited by the new landscape of our field and the energy that our department is bringing to the ECE profession.</p>'

Operators hide services that later turn out vulnerable, networks sporadically balance load through egregiously-long routing paths, and attackers avoid the network monitors used to capture them. Protecting and improving the Internet\’s operations requires near-real-time visibility into how networks, and their users, function in practice. Yet, there exists no complete ground truth on how the Internet operates because service configurations, user patterns, and network architectures are diverse, distributed, and ephemeral. There do exist systems that collect data and models that predict operations, but they rely on simplified or unvalidated assumptions about networks, operators, and attackers, restricting their visibility. Consequently, performance troubles and security vulnerabilities exist undetected, allowing them to evolve into catastrophic outages and breaches.</p><p>My research group builds data collection systems that rigorously account for the Internet\'s complexities to reveal in near-real time, previously-unseen critical operational challenges and threats. We investigate the complex behaviors of networks, attackers, and operators by using quantitative analysis, including non-parametric statistics, to validate and challenge community assumptions. </p><p> We build high-performance Internet scanning systems that learn from Internet service deployment patterns to provide the most accurate, global, and up-to-date view of different address spaces and network architectures of the Internet. We then use the data our systems collect to improve performance, defend against attackers, and develop empirical methodologies for future Internet analysis.</p><p>The operator, attacker, and network patterns that we have identified, along with our systems, have changed how researchers and industry search for performance faults and security threats on the Internet. Governments (e.g., US, UK) and companies (e.g., Hunt Intelligence, Peakhour, Censys) rely on our systems to proactively notify operators about vulnerabilities. Netflix is improving video delivery for over one million satellite users due to the global performance trends surfaced by our systems. As the Internet\'s complexity continues to increase, building data-collecting systems that provide complete and real-time Internet visibility is critical to prevent the Internet\'s largest performance and security failures from invisibly brewing.</p><p><span><b>Liz Izhikevich</b></span>is an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Quantum computers are now widely believed to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. However, the full scope of quantum computing’s power and the real-world applications where it can provide a meaningful “quantum advantage” remain key questions. At the forefront of this exploration is the intersection of quantum computation and physics, where novel algorithms could unlock groundbreaking capabilities in optimization, simulation, and machine learning.</p><p>My research group focuses on understanding and harnessing the capabilities of quantum computation to address fundamental and applied questions in computer science and physical systems. We aim to develop quantum algorithms that solve computationally hard problems, such as those in optimization, logistics, quantum chemistry, and materials science, in addition to studying the theoretical limitations of these methods. By bridging quantum information science, mathematical optimization, and statistical inference, our work seeks to uncover new applications of quantum algorithms and establish a solid theoretical foundation for their performance.</p><p>Currently, we are working on several exciting projects, including quantum optimization algorithms for hard combinatorial optimization problems, quantum simulations of many-body physics, and addressing computational-statistical gaps in high-dimensional data analysis. A key emphasis of our work is connecting theory with practice: we collaborate with partners in academia and industry (including Google, QuEra, Phasecraft, and BlueQubit) to implement quantum algorithms on near-term quantum hardware, such as superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and neutral atom platforms. These efforts aim to push the boundaries of computational feasibility and pave the way for demonstrating practical quantum advantages.</p><p><span>Leo Zhou  </span>  is an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles. He received his Ph.D. in Physics from Harvard University in 2021 under the guidance of Mikhail Lukin, after earning a B.Sc. in Physics and Mathematics at MIT in 2014. Before joining UCLA, he held a Burke Institute Prize Fellowship at Caltech and received the Outstanding Paper Award in 2022 at the 17th Conference on Theory of Quantum Computation. His research contributions include elucidating the advantages and limitations of quantum optimization algorithms and establishing foundational results in quantum complexity theory. He has collaborated closely with experimental groups to develop and test quantum applications on cutting-edge quantum devices. Through his research, he aims to deepen our understanding of quantum algorithms and their real-world impact while mentoring the next generation of quantum engineers and scientists.</p>'

As leader of the department, the chair’s duties include planning the programs, keeping the curriculum current, recruiting, selecting, and evaluating both faculty and staff personnel. Primarily, the chair is expected to maintain a climate that is hospitable to creativity and innovation. The Department Chair should be receptive to questions, discussions, and suggestions from members of the department (including faculty, staff personnel, and students), and should take appropriate action. Further, the chair of a department is expected to remain active in both teaching and research in order to maintain his or her capabilities in the appropriate field of scholarship.</p><p>The process for appointing or reappointing a Department Chair in the HSSEAS is not an election.
