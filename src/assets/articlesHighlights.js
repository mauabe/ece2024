Madni is recognized for leading the invention and commercialization of the MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) GyroChip, a life-saving sensing technology that revolutionized navigation and stability for aerospace and automotive safety systems. With his induction to the National Inventors Hall of Fame at an event in May in Washington D.C., Madni joins the ranks of some of the world’s most pivotal inventors, such as Louis Pasteur, the inventor of pasteurization; Samuel Morse, who invented the telegraph and Guglielmo Marconi, the inventor of the radio.</p></p>Professor Madni was elected a Life Fellow of The University of The Cambridge Philosophical Society, founded in 1819 and is Cambridge’s oldest scientific society. The society was granted a royal charter by King William IV in 1832 and is governed by an elected council of senior academics. The society has published several scientific journals, including Biological Reviews (established 1926) and Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society (published since 1843). The society fellows include 49 Nobel Laureates and recipients of The Copley Medal, The Royal Medal, The Dalton Medal, The Lomonosov Gold Medal, Max Planck Medal, The Goethe Prize, The Dirac Medal, The Eddington Medal, and the Albert Einstein Award to name but a few.</p></p>Professor Madni was also elected a Life Fellow of The Royal Society of Arts (RSA), founded in 1754 as the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce. It was granted a Royal Charter in 1847 with the mission to “embolden enterprise, enlarge science, refine art, improve our manufacturers and extend our commerce”, but also of the need to alleviate poverty and secure full employment. Notable Fellows include Charles Dickens, Benjamin Franklin, Stephen Hawking, Karl Marx, Adam Smith, Marie Curie, Nelson Mandela, David Attenborough, Judi Dench, William Hogarth, John Diefenbaker, and Tim Berners-Lee. Today, the RSA has fellows elected from 80 countries worldwide. The RSA’s Patron was Elizabeth II and its current president is The Princess Royal.</p> '
