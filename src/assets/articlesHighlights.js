His work will focus on side channels — any alternate or accidental entry points into an electronic system — that have the potential to create unwanted data leakage. To secure these pathways, Sehatbakhsh plans to create a suite of tools to analyze hardware, systems and computer software for unknown side channels. Findings from this research could lead to the development of more secure systems.</p><p>Since joining UCLA in 2020, Sehatbakhsh has received three additional NSF grants, totaling $1.8 million, for his research on Internet of Things devices.</p> '

His lengthy Latin American journey from 1799 to 1804 was celebrated as the second scientific discovery of South America.</p><p>The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation links Germany to the knowledge of the world. In global competition for the topmost experts, it offers various programmes to attract researchers at different stages of their careers. Support involves both funding and personal support in all matters relating to a stay in Germany and to subsequent cooperations. The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation offers further sponsorship in the framework of its alumni programs. In this way, an active international network of more than 30,000 researchers has evolved since the Foundation was established in 1953.<p></p>The Humboldt Research Awards have been a central pillar of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation’s sponsorship activities since 1972. The awards honour the academic achievements to date of internationally recognized scientists and scholars from abroad. A not insignificant number of award winners has subsequently been granted the Nobel Prize. The research award programmes take particular account of the needs of the international academic elite. The award winners are invited to spend time for research in Germany and are able to organize their stay on a flexible basis.</p>'

    textCopy: '  <p style="text-indent:0"><span class="first-letter">T</span>he ongoing revolution in artificial intelligence takes a ton of computing power — which, in turn, consumes a lot of electrical power and generates a lot of heat.</p><p>As AI software grows more powerful and more complex, that becomes a problem even in large, air-conditioned data centers with direct connections to the electrical grid. On what the military calls the “tactical edge” — the drones, manned aircraft, ground vehicles, forward command-posts, and individual kit that have to work in Ukrainian mud, Arctic snow, or desert sands — making an AI compact enough to function can be impossible.</p><p>To bypass this bottleneck of size, weight, power, and cooling, the Pentagon\’s branch for high-risk, high-reward R&D outfit known as DARPA launched a program in December known as OPTIMA, with awards to tech giant IBM, German semiconductor maker Infineon, and three US universities, Princeton, Georgia Tech, and UCLA. If DARPA exercises all its contract options, the total value could reach $78 million over four and a half years, allocating $8 million to UCLA. OPTIMA stands for “Optimum Processing Technology Inside Memory Arrays.”</p><p>As AI grows ever more powerful and power-hungry, tech pioneers keep seeking new and better kinds of chips, evolving from CPUs to the current array of of GPUs, TPUs, NPUs, FPGAs, and more. But all these different chips have a lot in common. In particular, they all have their memory on one part of the chip where they store data and their processor on another part where calculations are done on that data. That means every computation requires moving bits back and forth between the two zones. For most applications, for most of the history of computing, the tiny amount of time and energy required to make these minuscule movements didn\’t matter.</p><p>The UCLA team is using transistors instead of capacitors on their research. This is an approach that doesn\’t require exotic hardware. In fact, UCLA is using a widely-available transistor called the 22FDX.</p><p>“22FDX is actually an older model,” according to UCLA Professor Sudhakar Pamarti. But unlike most transistors, it can change something called its threshold voltage. Over years of work, Pamarti\’s team learned how to control those variations so precisely they can use them to encode data — over 50 times more compactly than alternative approaches, he said.</p><p>What if that threshold voltage glitches and garbles the data it\’s encoding? The UCLA team uses a calibration technique called “write-verify-write,” making tiny adjustments and then checking the output. This is “time consuming,” Pamarti acknowledged, but for most applications, you only have to do it once. IBM, Infineon, Georgia Tech and Priceton are working independently on their own models to fulfill their OPTIMA contract. Professors Puneet Gupta and Ken Yang join professor Pamarti leading the research at the Electrical Engineering Department.</p>'

Madni is recognized for leading the invention and commercialization of the MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) GyroChip, a life-saving sensing technology that revolutionized navigation and stability for aerospace and automotive safety systems. With his induction to the National Inventors Hall of Fame at an event in May in Washington D.C., Madni joins the ranks of some of the world’s most pivotal inventors, such as Louis Pasteur, the inventor of pasteurization; Samuel Morse, who invented the telegraph and Guglielmo Marconi, the inventor of the radio.</p></p>Professor Madni was elected a Life Fellow of The University of The Cambridge Philosophical Society, founded in 1819 and is Cambridge’s oldest scientific society. The society was granted a royal charter by King William IV in 1832 and is governed by an elected council of senior academics. The society has published several scientific journals, including Biological Reviews (established 1926) and Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society (published since 1843). The society fellows include 49 Nobel Laureates and recipients of The Copley Medal, The Royal Medal, The Dalton Medal, The Lomonosov Gold Medal, Max Planck Medal, The Goethe Prize, The Dirac Medal, The Eddington Medal, and the Albert Einstein Award to name but a few.</p></p>Professor Madni was also elected a Life Fellow of The Royal Society of Arts (RSA), founded in 1754 as the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce. It was granted a Royal Charter in 1847 with the mission to “embolden enterprise, enlarge science, refine art, improve our manufacturers and extend our commerce”, but also of the need to alleviate poverty and secure full employment. Notable Fellows include Charles Dickens, Benjamin Franklin, Stephen Hawking, Karl Marx, Adam Smith, Marie Curie, Nelson Mandela, David Attenborough, Judi Dench, William Hogarth, John Diefenbaker, and Tim Berners-Lee. Today, the RSA has fellows elected from 80 countries worldwide. The RSA’s Patron was Elizabeth II and its current president is The Princess Royal.</p> '
