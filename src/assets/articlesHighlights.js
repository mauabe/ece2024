    textCopy: '<p style="text-indent:0"><span class="first-letter">B</span>y the day, it is becoming more and more clear that emerging applications involving AI, extended reality, digital twins, and real-time control are shaping up to transform nearly all dimensions of daily life by the end of the decade, if not sooner. To fully deliver these transformative technologies, however, a new foundation of wireless connectivity is needed. </p><p>Wireless networks like cellular systems and Wi-Fi are typically evaluated on their ability to meet quantifiable requirements, most often in terms of network throughput, latency, and reliability. Future wireless networks will be expected to provide connectivity that is not only more stringent in terms of throughput, latency, and reliability but also more heterogeneous than ever before. Immersive experiences in extended reality, for example, will require extremely high throughput for rich visual scenes, extremely low latency for seamless interactions with others, and extremely high reliability for uninterrupted use and ubiquitous adoption. Interestingly, future wireless networks are also being tasked with providing new, expanded services beyond connectivity such as sensing and localization for applications aiming to perceive, digitize, and/or interact with the real world. </p><p>My goal is to conduct research and create technologies that drive the design, development, and deployment of these future wireless networks, with a particular focus on 5G and future 6G cellular networks. To accomplish this, my lab uses mathematical tools, machine learning, and real-world hardware to analyze, model, optimize, and prototype wireless systems and solutions. When possible and practical, we incorporate experimental components into our research efforts by collecting measurements, prototyping solutions, and evaluating proposed designs, which ultimately allows us to conduct research more likely to have real-world impact.</p><p>Beyond research, I am passionate about teaching students the fundamentals of wireless communication and introducing them to the technologies that have rapidly transformed wireless connectivity over the past two decades. My aim is to equip students with the skills and knowledge necessary to become wireless engineers capable of solving real-world problems and to excite them about the underlying technologies connecting our world.</p><p>Bio: Ian P. Roberts is an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCLA, where he leads the Wireless Lab in conducting theoretical and experimental research on wireless communication and sensing. Prior to joining UCLA, he completed his Ph.D. at the University of Texas at Austin, where he was an NSF Graduate Research Fellow in the Wireless Networking and Communications Group. He has industry experience developing and prototyping wireless technologies at AT&T Labs, Amazon, GenXComm (startup), Sandia National Labs, and Dynetics (defense contractor). During his time at GenXComm, he created and demonstrated their earliest wireless solutions combining RF, photonic, and digital signal processing for interference cancellation.

In this ongoing energy revolution, power electronics are evolving from being edge devices to becoming the “centrex” of the energy internet. Due to the high controllability, speed, and power density of power electronics, future energy systems can be more heterogeneous in form, more agile in actuation, larger in scale, and more distributed in function. The ultimate energy system should deliver the right energy to the right place at the right time. However, the cost and speed limitations of power converters restrict the flexibility and bandwidth of energy transfer. Moreover, most of the current models, controls, and designs do not align with each other. Models are either too simple to capture the underlying physics or too complicated to be utilized for design, while rigorous control laws result in overly conservative control performance. Much of the practical hardware is rule-based and semi-empirical.</p><p>   My research group focuses on the algorithm and hardware that transform power-electronics-based energy systems, from those as small as power conversion circuits to those as large as interconnected microgrids, from those as fast as electromagnetic transients to those as slow as electrochemical dynamics. Currently, we are working on projects including high-speed high-frequency power converters for information & data systems, power management of second-life battery energy storage systems, nonlinear control and transient stability of microgrids, and distributed energy generation & integration. Our ultimate research goal is to bridge the fundamental theory and emerging applications of power-electronics-dominated energy systems by innovating control-aware modeling frameworks, high-performance hardware validations, provably-correct control policies, and physics-informed learning schemes. </p><p>   Xiaofan Cui is an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles.
