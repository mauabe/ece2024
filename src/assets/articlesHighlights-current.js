A design team headed by assistant manager and engineer Donald Frey was formed and the new project was titled the “T-5”. After some consideration it was agreed that a cross breed roadster and Ford Falcon would be more suitable to modern demands. </p><p>After all, the Ford Thunderbird, which was Ford’s most recent two seater car, did not fair as well as expected in current car markets. The T-5 was given a new design commission and Lee Iacocco gives much credit to the efforts of stylist David Ash for making the renamed “Mustang” a smashing success.</p><p>    In 1964 production was in high gear for the newly designed 1965 Ford Mustang. </p><p>    Clearly the new Ford Mustang was suddenly everywhere! It was even featured in 1964’s Bond movie, Goldfinger! Yes, the Mustang was an instant hit! A true royal gem in Ford’s car making history.  Ford is still continuing the Mustang line and even the newer Mustangs are a modern collectors item. </p> '

Future wireless networks have to provide connectivity that is not only more stringent but also more heterogeneous than ever before. Immersive experiences in extended reality, for example, will require (i) extremely high throughput for rich visual scenes, (ii) extremely low latency for seamless interactions with others, and (iii) extremely high reliability for uninterrupted use and ubiquitous adoption. Future wireless networks will also providing new, expanded services beyond connectivity such as sensing and localization for applications aiming to perceive, digitize, and/or interact with the real world. </p><p> My goal is to conduct research and create technologies that drive the design, development, and deployment of these future wireless networks, with a particular focus on 5G and future 6G cellular networks. To accomplish this, my lab uses mathematical tools, machine learning, and real-world hardware to analyze, model, optimize, and prototype wireless systems and solutions. When possible and practical, we incorporate experimental components into our research efforts by collecting measurements, prototyping solutions, and evaluating proposed designs, which ultimately allows us to conduct research more likely to have real-world impact.</p><p>    I am also passionate about teaching students the fundamentals of wireless communication and introducing them to the technologies that have rapidly transformed wireless connectivity over the past two decades.

In this ongoing energy revolution, power electronics are evolving from being edge devices to becoming the “centrex” of the energy internet. Due to the high controllability, speed, and power density of power electronics, future energy systems can be more heterogeneous in form, more agile in actuation, larger in scale, and more distributed in function. The ultimate energy system should deliver the right energy to the right place at the right time. However, the cost and speed limitations of power converters restrict the flexibility and bandwidth of energy transfer. Moreover, most of the current models, controls, and designs do not align with each other. Models are either too simple to capture the underlying physics or too complicated to be utilized for design, while rigorous control laws result in overly conservative control performance. Much of the practical hardware is rule-based and semi-empirical.</p><p>   My research group focuses on the algorithm and hardware that transform power-electronics-based energy systems, from those as small as power conversion circuits to those as large as interconnected microgrids, from those as fast as electromagnetic transients to those as slow as electrochemical dynamics. Currently, we are working on projects including high-speed high-frequency power converters for information & data systems, power management of second-life battery energy storage systems, nonlinear control and transient stability of microgrids, and distributed energy generation & integration. Our ultimate research goal is to bridge the fundamental theory and emerging applications of power-electronics-dominated energy systems by innovating control-aware modeling frameworks, high-performance hardware validations, provably-correct control policies, and physics-informed learning schemes. </p><p>   Xiaofan Cui is an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles.

    textCopy: '<p style="text-indent:0"><span class="first-letter">A</span>chuta Kadambi has received the Outstanding Young Professional Award from the honor society Eta Kappa Nu of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Established in 1936, the award recognizes outstanding engineers who are under 35 years of age with exceptional career accomplishments. Kadambi, who also has a faculty appointment in computer science, was selected for his “contributions to creative and inclusive teaching and mentoring in electrical engineering and bioengineering.” <p/><p> Kadambi leads the Visual Machines Group at UCLA, which focuses on building computational imaging systems with applications in robotics and health care. Through his research, Kadambi aims to address implicit biases in medical and other devices and to explore pragmatic solutions. Separate from his work at UCLA, Kadambi also co-founded Akasha Imaging, a commercial imaging technology company. <p/><p> “The most enjoyable part of research is the students I get to work with. Since I started as a faculty, PhD students Pradyumna Chari has been a sounding board for these problems, and has been joined by PhD students Sasha Vilesov and Ellin Zhao. This project is also not possible without the rigorous clinical collaboration of UCLA medical school faculty Dr. Laleh Jalilian,” said Professor Kadambi.  “We are placing a bet that 21st century society demands that life-saving medical devices work for all humans, not just a subset. If this bet is correct, I envision research like ours will be a critical part of future products that are deployed in hospitals.”<p/><p>  Remote Heart Rate Sensors Can be Biased Against Darker Skin. Professor Kadambi\'s  Team Offers a Solution. <p/><p> As telemedicine has grown more popular, so have devices that allow people to measure their vital signs from home and transmit the results by computer to their doctors. Yet in many cases, obtaining accurate remote readings for people of color has proved a persistent challenge. Take remote heart rate measurements, for example, which rely on a camera sensing subtle changes in the color of a patient’s face caused by fluctuations in the flow of blood beneath their skin. These devices, part of an emerging class of remote technologies, consistently have trouble reading color changes in people with darker skin tones.<p/><p>Kadambi and his team have now developed a remote diagnostic technique that overcomes this implicit bias against darker skin while also making heart rate readings more accurate for patients across the full range of skin tones. Their secret? Combining the light-based measurements of a camera with radio-based measurements from radar. The researchers presented their findings, recently published in the journal ACM Transactions on Graphics, at the SIGGRAPH 2022 conference in Vancouver, British Columbia. The conference, held both virtually and in-person, is organized annually by members of the Association for Computing Machinery.<p/><p>The advance could lead to new classes of high-performing medical devices and remote technologies that are more accurate and equitable, the researchers said, allowing doctors and health care systems to remotely monitor patients with confidence, both in clinical settings and from patients’ homes. “In the larger picture, this work shows that practical and innovative engineering solutions can address persistent biases in medical devices,” said Kadambi, who is also a member of the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA. “But that first requires an acknowledgement that such bias means the current best technology may not be the best for everyone. Through thoughtful design, we can find equitable solutions that perform as well or better.”<p/><p>The UCLA team’s fusion of two techniques shows a promising path toward achieving those goals, said Kadambi, who is the principal investigator on the research. As head of the Visual Machines Group at UCLA, he has written about different types of biases in medical devices and how to fix them. In developing their new technology, the researchers first showed that the remote sensing device itself was the source of the bias, demonstrating in their paper that higher levels of melanin, natural pigments in the skin, interfere with what is known as the photoplethysmography, or PPG, signal that is used in current camera-based remote heart rate measurements. PPG signaling is also used to measure heart rate through devices like pulse oximeters, which clamp onto a patient’s finger, as well as some wearable commercial products and smartwatch-powered apps. These devices emit light onto the skin and sense changes in the amount of light reflected back by circulating blood just below the surface. That reflected light produces the PPG signal, a measure of a patient’s heart rate.<p/><p>Previous efforts to address skin tone biases in such technologies have generally looked to correct them through additional programming or by expanding baseline standards using a more diverse range of skin tones. But neither of these approaches target the real issue, Kadambi said, which is the physics of the device itself. The UCLA researchers instead turned to another technology that can give an estimate of heart rate: radar. At 77 gigahertz, a radar can sense subtle changes in the displacement of the chest from heartbeats. And while this method overcomes the issue of skin tone bias, it is less reliable than PPG signaling. However, they found success by combining these two different modes of sensing — camera and radar — and refining them through machine learning to work in concert.<p/><p>  A senior member of the National Academy of Inventors, professor Kadambi has also been honored with Young Faculty Award from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA),  National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award, an Army Research Office Young Investigator Award and a Google Faculty award. In 2019, he was named to Forbes’ “30 Under 30” list for science. The IEEE is the world’s largest technical professional organization with more than 423,000 members worldwide.  </p>'
