    <div class="page-text">
        <p  style="text-indent:0">Henry Samueli is the 2025 IEEE Medal of Honor Laureate, recognized for developing communications products that have touched virtually every person in the world. He was presented with his medal at the IEEE Honors Ceremony on 24 April 2025 in Tokyo, Japan. An IEEE-Eta Kappa Nu Eminent Member, Samueli has given the $2M prize to fund a permanent endowment for Eta Kappa Nu. This permanent endowment will further his commitment to developing future leaders.

        The IEEE Medal of Honor is the highest IEEE award, and  one of the world’s most prestigious technology-focused prizes. It was established in 1917 to recognize key advances in radio technologies by the greatest minds of our time for work that benefits humanity. Effective in 2025, IEEE increased the IEEE Medal of Honor monetary prize to $2 million because we are at an inflection point globally – where technology, engineering, and science have become integral to addressing global challenges such as climate change and positively moving our world forward. In the evaluation process, the significance of achievement, originality, impact on society, impact on the profession, publications and patents relating to the achievement, and quality of nomination are the top criteria.

        <p  style="text-indent:0"> The <span>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers </span> has announced the election of Puneet Gupta a Fellow of the Class of 2022. The IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity. It is designed to serve professionals involved in all aspects of the electrical, electronic, and computing fields and related areas of science and technology that underlie modern civilization.</p><p>

        IEEE's roots go back to 1884 when electricity began to become a major influence in society. There was one major established electrical industry, the telegraph, which since the 1840s had come to connect the world with a data communications system faster than the speed of transportation. Names such as  Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell and founding President Norvin Green of Western Union, saw technologies evolve from the telegraph, telephone, electric power, radio, and modern globalized communication systems of today. It has over 400,000 members in 160 countries. <span>www.ieee.org </span></p>
