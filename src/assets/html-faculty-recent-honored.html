    <h3 class="page-title">Henry Samueli Received the IEEE 2025 Medal of Honor </h3>
    <div class="page-text">
        <p  style="text-indent:0">Henry Samueli is the 2025 IEEE Medal of Honor Laureate, recognized for developing communications products that have touched virtually every person in the world. He was presented with his medal at the IEEE Honors Ceremony on 24 April 2025 in Tokyo, Japan. An IEEE-Eta Kappa Nu Eminent Member, Samueli has given the $2M prize to fund a permanent endowment for Eta Kappa Nu. This permanent endowment will further his commitment to developing future leaders.
         </p>
        <p>
        The IEEE Medal of Honor is the highest IEEE award, and  one of the world\’s most prestigious technology-focused prizes. It was established in 1917 to recognize key advances in radio technologies by the greatest minds of our time for work that benefits humanity. Effective in 2025, IEEE increased the IEEE Medal of Honor monetary prize to $2 million because we are at an inflection point globally – where technology, engineering, and science have become integral to addressing global challenges such as climate change and positively moving our world forward. In the evaluation process, the significance of achievement, originality, impact on society, impact on the profession, publications and patents relating to the achievement, and quality of nomination are the top criteria.

Three UCLA Engineers Named Fellows of American Association for the Advancement of Science

Three professors at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering have been elected fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world’s largest multidisciplinary scientific society. Jane Chang of chemical and biomolecular engineering, and Mona Jarrahi and Chee Wei Wong of electrical and computer engineering were elected for their major scientific achievements across the fields of nanoscale thin-film engineering, terahertz optoelectronics and chip-scale photonics, respectively.

The AAAS announced today its 2024 class of 471 new fellows, and the trio is among 10 UCLA faculty members being recognized for their significant scientific and social contributions.

Chang, who holds the William Frederick Seyer Endowed Chair in Materials Electrochemistry, is also a professor of materials science and engineering and a member of the California NanoSystems Institute (CNSI) at UCLA. She focuses on the synthesis and patterning of multi-functional complex oxide films with tailored electronic, chemical, thermal, mechanical and biological properties. She leads the Electronic Materials Synthesis and Plasma Processing Lab, which has developed plasma etching at the atomic scale, enabling the creation of structured films. Chang is a fellow of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers and the American Vacuum Society. In 2018, she became the first woman to win the AVS Plasma Prize. Chang previously served as the director of Function Accelerated nanoMaterial Engineering — a major multidisciplinary research consortium headquartered at UCLA and supported by the Semiconductor Research Corporation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

Jarrahi, who holds the Northrop Grumman Chair in Electrical Engineering, directs the Terahertz Electronics Laboratory where she studies ultrafast electronic and optoelectronic devices. A member of CNSI at UCLA, Jarrahi’s research focuses on expanding the capabilities and applications of terahertz sensing, imaging and communication systems. Widely recognized for her innovative plasmonic and optical advancements, Jarrahi is a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the American Physical Society, the optical society Optica, the international society for optics and photonics SPIE, and the Institute of Physics. Among the many honors she has received are the Institution of Engineering and Technology A.F. Harvey Prize, the Moore Inventor Fellowship from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers. She is also a recipient of UCLA Samueli’s Watanabe Excellence in Research award.

Wong, who holds the Carol and Lawrence E. Tannas, Jr. Endowed Term Chair in Engineering, specializes in quantum optics and photonics. His research focuses on nonlinear, quantum and ultrafast optics as well as precision measurement. He leads the Mesoscopic Optics and Quantum Electronics Laboratory, studying the intersection of optical physics, device optoelectronics and solid-state science and engineering, leveraging photonic crystals and chip-scale photonics. The group has achieved breakthroughs in optical physics and sciences with optoelectronic applications in industry. Wong has been named a fellow of the National Academy of Inventors, IEEE, SPIE, Optica and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. He has received the National Institutes of Health Trailblazer award for his development of precision magnetometry at the thermodynamical and quantum limits. He is a member of CNSI and the B. John Garrick Institute for the Risk Sciences at UCLA.

Other recent UCLA Samueli professors who have been inducted to the AAAS include Yi Tang of chemical and biomolecular engineering in 2023, Rafail Ostrovsky of computer science in 2022, and Yang Yang of materials science and engineering and bioengineering in 2019.

Founded in 1848, the nonprofit American Association for the Advancement of Science has more than 120,000 members across nearly 100 countries and is the publisher of Science and other peer-reviewed journals. The association includes more than 250 affiliated societies and academies of science, serving 10 million members.

    <div class="page-text">
        <p  style="text-indent:0"> The <span>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers </span> has announced the election of Puneet Gupta a Fellow of the Class of 2022. The IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity. It is designed to serve professionals involved in all aspects of the electrical, electronic, and computing fields and related areas of science and technology that underlie modern civilization.</p><p>

        IEEE's roots go back to 1884 when electricity began to become a major influence in society. There was one major established electrical industry, the telegraph, which since the 1840s had come to connect the world with a data communications system faster than the speed of transportation. Names such as  Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell and founding President Norvin Green of Western Union, saw technologies evolve from the telegraph, telephone, electric power, radio, and modern globalized communication systems of today. It has over 400,000 members in 160 countries. <span>www.ieee.org </span></p>
