        <p  style="text-indent:0">Henry Samueli is the 2025 IEEE Medal of Honor Laureate, recognized for developing communications products that have touched virtually every person in the world. He was presented with his medal at the IEEE Honors Ceremony on 24 April 2025 in Tokyo, Japan. An IEEE-Eta Kappa Nu Eminent Member, Samueli has given the $2M prize to fund a permanent endowment for Eta Kappa Nu. This permanent endowment will further his commitment to developing future leaders.

        The IEEE Medal of Honor is the highest IEEE award, and  one of the world’s most prestigious technology-focused prizes. It was established in 1917 to recognize key advances in radio technologies by the greatest minds of our time for work that benefits humanity. Effective in 2025, IEEE increased the IEEE Medal of Honor monetary prize to $2 million because we are at an inflection point globally – where technology, engineering, and science have become integral to addressing global challenges such as climate change and positively moving our world forward. In the evaluation process, the significance of achievement, originality, impact on society, impact on the profession, publications and patents relating to the achievement, and quality of nomination are the top criteria.

<!-- NAE OZCAN LIXIA -->



Two faculty members from the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering — Aydogan Ozcan and Lixia Zhang — have been elected to the National Academy of Engineering, one of the highest professional honors granted to American engineers.

 

Aydogan Ozcan was elected to the National Academy of Engineers for his “contributions to mobile sensing and telepathology for medical diagnostics.” He holds the Volgenau Chair in Engineering Innovation at ECE, as well as a joint appointment at bioengineering. A pioneer of computational optics, Ozcan has developed new technologies with broad applications in biomedicine and health care that have helped increase access to advanced measurements in resource-limited areas. 

He has created high-resolution imaging and sensing techniques for use in mobile phones and other lower-cost portable devices, eliminating the need for bulky and expensive equipment, and has developed a series of innovative microscopy techniques that use algorithms rather than traditional optical lenses for high-volume, high-resolution rapid imaging for biomedical sensing and diagnostics. In recent years, he has incorporated artificial intelligence into his work in advanced optics and microscopy tools.

At UCLA, Ozcan is also the associate director at the California NanoSystems Institute and is a professor with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

Ozcan holds more than 85 patents and has co-founded three startup companies based on technologies spun out of his research. 

For the past five years, he has been recognized as one of the world’s most highly cited researchers by the international data and analytics firm Clarivate. Ozcan joined UCLA’s faculty in 2007 following a research faculty position at Harvard Medical School and a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford University, where he earned his doctorate.

Lixia Zhang was elected to the NAE for her “development of internet protocols which significantly impacted internet quality and performance, and for leadership in setting standards.” Zhang, a distinguished professor of computer science who holds the Jonathan B. Postel Chair in Computer Networks, has been an influential researcher for more than three decades in the architecture, performance and security of the internet and its connected devices.  

Among Zhang’s most notable achievements is the design of the Resource Reservation Protocol, or RSVP, a robust network signaling protocol used to manage network resources that has sustained internet growth for over two decades. Zhang also coined the term “middlebox” to describe newer network devices such as firewalls and network address translators, which represent departures from the original internet protocol architecture. In 2010, Zhang was named the lead principal investigator of the Named Data Networking project, a multi-institutional initiative funded by the National Science Foundation. 

In addition to her scholarly work, Zhang was also an early contributor to the Internet Engineering Task Force, a global body that lays out the technical standards of the internet. She has also been one of the longest-serving members on the Internet Architecture Board. Prior to joining UCLA’s faculty in 1995, Zhang worked at the XEROX Palo Alto Research Center. She obtained her bachelor’s/first degree from Heilongjiang University, Harbin, China, in 1976, a master’s degree at UCLA in 1981, and a doctorate at MIT in 1989.

Dariush Divsalar

Divsalar M.S. ’75, Engr ’77,  Ph.D. ’78, an adjunct professor of electrical and computer engineering at UCLA Samueli, is a senior research scientist and fellow at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He was elected to the academy for his “theory and practice of channel codes that impact deep-space communications.”

Since 1978, Divsalar has worked at JPL on advanced deep-space communications systems for NASA missions, primarily through the development of coding and signal modulation techniques. His breakthroughs include extending the range and capacity of these systems and protecting the transmitted data’s integrity. Some of his advances have also been incorporated into modern wireless communications applications.

Divsalar’s many honors include NASA’s Exceptional Engineering Achievement Medal and Distinguished Public Service Medal, the Ellis Island Medal of Honor and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers’ Alexander Graham Bell Medal. He is also a fellow of IEEE.

At UCLA, Divsalar has frequently taught classes on digital communication systems and has served on several doctoral dissertation committees. He is also a triple Bruin engineer, having earned his master’s, engineer and doctoral degrees from UCLA Samueli.
