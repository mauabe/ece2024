    <span class="first-letter">W</span>hen United Airlines Flight 93 was hijacked, thirteen passengers and crew members responded by placing phone calls to the authorities, to United Airlines, and to their family members and friends. According to the FBI, thirty-seven phone calls were placed from on board Flight 93 between 9:28 when the plane was hijacked until the time of the crash at 10:03. Thirty-five of these calls were made on the Airfones located on the back of the seats in the last nine rows of the plane. Credit card records reveal the time of the call, Airfone caller’s name, the number or numbers dialed, the duration of the call, and the row from which the call was placed. These phone records were entered as evidence during the sentencing trial of Zacarias Moussaoui in 2006. 
  </p>
  <p>
    According to the 9/11 Commission Report, the series of calls from the flight provided vital information both to the ground and to the passengers. Calls from on board the plane revealed that: the plane had been hijacked the hijackers wielded knives the hijackers had entered the cockpit the hijackers had a bomb the hijackers wore red bandanas the passengers were forced to the back of the aircraft a passenger had been stabbed (reported by at least two callers) and the victim had died (reported by one) two individuals were lying on the floor of the aircraft injured or dead, possibly the captain and first officer a flight attendant had been killed Through these phone calls, the passengers and crew learned that: The World Trade Center Towers were struck by two commercial airliners The Pentagon was struck by a commercial airliner.

    <span class="first-letter">T </span> his past year at UCLA’s Electrical and Computer Engineering Department has yet again been marked by the remarkable achievements of our students and faculty. UCLA ECE continues to impact the greater electrical and computer engineering community with our education, service, and research efforts.
  </p>
  <p>
    We welcomed three new faculty this past year. Prof. Liz Izhikevich, who obtained her degree from Stanford University, is a pioneer on network security through examining network traffic and characteristics using innovative “scanning” methods and algorithms. Prof. Di Luo, who came us from University of Illinois Urbana-Champagne, works broadly in the use of computation in solving problems in quantum science. He uses machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to make modifications to AI algorithms and explores quantum algorithms for optimization. And, Prof. Leo Zhou, fresh from his post-doctoral research at CalTech, bridges information theory (statistical sampling theory), optimization, and theoretical physics and has been able to combine them to identify problems that highlights the computational advantage of quantum computing, and realization of these quantum applications in real physical systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also welcomed back two of our faculty from their service (Intergovernmental Personnel Act) to the U.S. government. Prof. Jason Woo completed his four years as a Program Manager for DARPA’s Microsystems Technology Office and Prof. Subramanian Iyer completed one year as the Director of National Advanced Packaging and Manufacturing Program. Both of them were seminal in guiding the advancement of the semiconductor manufacturing and research of our nation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Members of our UCLA community have been recognized by the engineering community at large. To highlight a few, Prof. Aydogan Ozcan, for his contributions in photonics, Prof. Lixia Zhang, for her contributions in computer networking, and Adj. Professor Dariush Divsalar, for his contribution at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, were elected to the National Academy of Engineering, the highest honor in an engineer career. Assistant Professor Nader Sehatbakhsh received the National Science Foundation CAREER award for “Integrating Microarchitecture Simulation and Side-Channel Leakage Modeling for Safer Software”. For teaching, Associate Professor Jonathan Kao received Northrop Grumman Excellence in Teaching Award. Prof. Behzad Razavi was awarded funds to establish the Center for Education of Microchip Designers (CEMiD) by the National Center for the Advancement of Semiconductor Technology (NatCAST). Our students were also recognized. Professor Aydin Babakhani's student, Sidharth Thomas, received the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society (SSCS) Predoctoral Achievement Award. Haoxiang Ren and Fulian Hung who work with Prof. Subramanian Iyer and C.K. Ken Yang won the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship. And, our IEEE student group was recognized with IEEE Rising Star for Introductory Projects for their work on “Open Project Space” and for Advanced Project for “WRAP RF Design Systems”.
  </p>
  <p>
    This report also highlights recent work funded by DARPA on Optimum Processing Technology Inside Memory Arrays (OPTIMA) led by Prof. Sudhakar Pamarti using energy-efficient analog computing for neural net computation. Programs like this are just one example of the multitude of research efforts that amounts to grant funding of over $35M in the past year in the department.
  </p>
  <p>
    This annual report and our website reflect a change in how we organize our research that was initiated this past year. The new series of tracks better illustrate the collaborative and multi-disciplinary nature of ECE research and education engaged by our students and faculty. As my tenure as chairman comes to a close, I pen this final introductory message of an annual report and am pleased to be passing the chairman’s duties to Prof. Benjamin Williams. The past five years have been a whirlwind and I am excited by the new landscape of our field and the energy that our department is bringing to the ECE profession.

  <span class="first-letter">E</span>ver since physicists identified the transformative potential of computers exploiting quantum effects in the 1980s, the field of quantum information science has revolutionized both our understanding of Nature and our belief of what is computationally possible. Quantum computers are now widely believed to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. However, the full scope of quantum computing’s power and the real-world applications where it can provide a meaningful “quantum advantage” remain key questions. At the forefront of this exploration is the intersection of quantum computation and physics, where novel algorithms could unlock groundbreaking capabilities in optimization, simulation, and machine learning.
</p>
<p>
  My research group focuses on understanding and harnessing the capabilities of quantum computation to address fundamental and applied questions in computer science and physical systems. We aim to develop quantum algorithms that solve computationally hard problems, such as those in optimization, logistics, quantum chemistry, and materials science, in addition to studying the theoretical limitations of these methods. By bridging quantum information science, mathematical optimization, and statistical inference, our work seeks to uncover new applications of quantum algorithms and establish a solid theoretical foundation for their performance.
</p>
<p>
  Currently, we are working on several exciting projects, including quantum optimization algorithms for hard combinatorial optimization problems, quantum simulations of many-body physics, and addressing computational-statistical gaps in high-dimensional data analysis. A key emphasis of our work is connecting theory with practice: we collaborate with partners in academia and industry (including Google, QuEra, Phasecraft, and BlueQubit) to implement quantum algorithms on near-term quantum hardware, such as superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and neutral atom platforms. These efforts aim to push the boundaries of computational feasibility and pave the way for demonstrating practical quantum advantages.

  <span class="first-letter">I</span>nternet security and performance problems often persist invisibly.  Operators hide services that later turn out vulnerable, networks sporadically balance load through egregiously-long routing paths, and attackers avoid the network monitors used to capture them. Protecting and improving the Internet's operations requires near-real-time visibility into how networks, and their users, function in practice. Yet, there exists no complete ground truth on how the Internet operates because service configurations, user patterns, and network architectures are diverse, distributed, and ephemeral. There do exist systems that collect data and models that predict operations, but they rely on simplified or unvalidated assumptions about networks, operators, and attackers, restricting their visibility. Consequently, performance troubles and security vulnerabilities exist undetected, allowing them to evolve into catastrophic outages and breaches.

<p style="text-indent:0"><span class="first-letter">A</span>rtificial Intelligence (AI) and quantum computation are transforming the landscape of science and technology, offering unprecedented tools for solving complex problems. AI has revolutionized fields such as image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems by enabling machines to learn from data and make intelligent decisions. At the same time, quantum computation promises to surpass classical limits by leveraging quantum mechanical principles to perform certain computations exponentially faster. Together, AI and quantum computing not only open new frontiers in materials discovery, drug design, and optimization but also challenge and enrich our fundamental understanding of computation, learning, and physical laws.
</p>
<p>
My research is at the intersection of AI, science, and quantum computation, aiming to develop intelligent systems that advance both scientific discovery and computational capability. I design machine learning and quantum algorithms that integrate physical principles to model complex systems, accelerate simulations, and solve high-impact problems in science and engineering. At the same time, I explore how mathematical structures and quantum theory can inspire novel AI architectures and robotics algorithms with enhanced generalization, interpretability, and adaptability. By bridging AI, physics, and quantum computing, my work drives innovation across disciplines and opens new directions for both scientific understanding and intelligent technology.

<!-- Park on Yang and new Dean -->

<p style="text-indent:0"><span class="first-letter">P</span>rofessor Ken Yang has been serving as Chair of Electrical and Computer Engineering. His term is ending at the end of June 2025and he has expressed a desire to step down. I would like to take this opportunity to express my personal gratitude and that of my colleagues to Professor Yang for his stewardship of the ECE Department and to congratulate him on a job well done.  
</p>
<p>
 During his tenure, Professor Yang has been successful in recruiting excellent faculty members, managing departmental resources, and improving the curriculum at both undergraduate and graduate levels.Under his leadership, the department strengthened multidisciplinary collaborations and created a diverse and inclusive environment for students, faculty, and staff. While providing service to the department, Professor Yang has maintained a very active and distinguished record of research, teaching, and mentoring of graduate students. As such he joins a select company of department Chairs.
</p>
<p>
We faced the challenging task of finding someone to lead the Department for the next several years and maintain the tradition of excellent leadership. As leader of the department, the chair’s duties include planning the programs, keeping the curriculum current, recruiting, selecting, and evaluating both faculty and staff personnel. Primarily, the chair is expected to maintain a climate that is hospitable to creativity and innovation. The Department Chair should be receptive to questions, discussions, and suggestions from members of the department (including faculty, staff personnel, and students), and should take appropriate action. Further, the chair of a department is expected to remain active in both teaching and research in order to maintain his or her capabilities in the appropriate field of scholarship. 
</p>
<p>
The process for appointing or reappointing a Department Chair in the HSSEAS is not an election. The pitfall with conducting an election is that it can result in putting forward someone who may not have the qualities that management of an academic department requires:
<br>
The ability to espouse the vision necessary to lead the department in its quest for excellence and improved national ranking.
<br>
  The fundamental commitment to the department and its mission — that is, an attitude of service to the department.
<br>
  The personality and attitude for collegiality, diplomacy, and fairness in dealing with people.
<br>
  The broad reputation to greatly enhance the department’s visibility in the national and international scientific community.
<br>
</p>
<p>
We welcome Benjamin Williams as the new chair for the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. We wish him all the best in his tenure and hoping he leads the ECE Department on the path to excellence.
