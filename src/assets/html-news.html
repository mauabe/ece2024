  <span class="first-letter">A</span>ssociate professor Sam Emaminejad from the
  ECE department, with members of his UCLA Interconnected and Integrated
  Bioelectronics Lab (I²BL) in collaboration with colleagues from Stanford
  University, developed a technology that can analyze blood composition with the
  touch of a finger. This secure, noninvasive technology uses a
  signal-interpretation framework that can present detailed information about an
  individual\’s blood composition--such as metabolites, hormones, nutrients,
  pharmaceuticals, as well as blood oxygen. The first-of-its-kind system builds
  on previous skin-sensing technologies developed by the researchers, and a
  paper describing the new technology has recently been published in Proceedings
  of the National Academy of Science (PNAS).
</p>
<p>
  One potential application of the technology is to embed the sensors in cars\'
  steering wheels to measure blood alcohol and drug levels, preventing a driver
  to operate the vehicle under the influence (DUI). The system also could be
  incorporated into heavy machinery to ensure their operators are authorized and
  physically sound. "This touch-based technology can serve as a human-machine
  interface to perceive and interpret what\’s inside someone\’s body," said
  study leader and senior author Sam Emaminejad. "It provides much richer
  information about our health than current touch-based biosensors such as pulse
  oximeters."
</p>
<p>
  The system, described by the researchers as a "cryptographic bio-human machine
  interface", or CB-HMI, uses thin hydrogel-coated chemical sensors to collect
  and detect particular circulating molecules on the skin through natural
  perspiration.
</p>
<p>
  "This combines the familiarity of a fingerprint scan, such as the one that
  unlocks some smartphone models, with our advances in noninvasive diagnostics
  that can detect trace molecules circulating in our body that have been
  traditionally collected in samples of blood, saliva and other fluids", said
  Emaminejad, who is also a member of the UCLA California NanoSystems Institute.
  "Importantly, it also can encrypt the data at the point of collection by
  leveraging the individual\’s unique fingerprint as a key, so the collected
  data remain secure and private."
</p>
<p>
  For their experiments, the researchers developed thin hydrogel-coated sensors
  to measure ethanol and acetaminophen levels in the participants. They
  integrated these sensors with other biosensors and a fingerprint scanner and
  developed accompanying algorithms to decipher the information. "The system
  authenticated the user before proceeding to the next steps", said lead author
  Shuyu Lin, a UCLA doctoral student and member of the Interconnected and
  Integrated Bioelectronics Lab. "We also applied our interface to create a
  smart medication dispenser that dispenses only the appropriate amount of
  acetaminophen depending on current levels in the blood."
</p>
<p>
  The researchers envision that such interfaces could be extended to
  create<span>"smart"</span>surroundings that adapt to individuals\’ needs and
  to monitor patients remotely. When connected to a aptop or tablet, the system
  could relay real-time, detailed physiological information from a patient to a
  doctor during a video visit.

  The other lead authors of the paper are Emaminejad\’s UCLA graduate students
  and lab members Jialun Zhu and Wenzhuo Yu. Other UCLA authors from his lab
  include Bo Wang, Kiarash Sabet, Yichao Zhao, Xuanbing Cheng, Hannaneh Hojaiji,
  Haisong Lin and Jiawei Tan. The other senior authors are Dr. Carlos Milla and
  Ronald Davis from Stanford University. The research is supported by National
  Science Foundation\’s Smart and Connected Health program, Precise Advanced
  Technologies and Health Systems for Underserved Populations (PATHS-UP), PhRMA
  Foundation, UCLA Samueli School of Engineering and a UCLA Electrical and
  Computer Engineering Preliminary Examination Fellowship (to Shuyu Lin). The
  UCLA Technology Development Group has filed for a provisional U.S. patent on
  the technology for Emaminejad and the three lead authors.
