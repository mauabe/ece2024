The algorithm enhances the visibility and color of both still images and videos at record speed. Led by Bahram Jalali, distinguished professor emeritus of electrical and computer engineering as well as bioengineering, the team has established a new paradigm for algorithm design where laws of physics provide a blueprint for crafting algorithms.</p><p>  The team published this week its aptly named approach \u201cVEViD,\u201d which stands for Vision Enhancement via Virtual-diffraction and coherent Detection, in the optics journal, eLight. Callen MacPhee, a UCLA electrical engineering graduate student pursuing a master\u2019s degree, is the co-author. The new methodology is in sharp contrast to both classical algorithms based on empirical hand-crafted rules and modern artificial intelligence algorithms that rely on a massive amount of computations involving millions of parameters. \u201cOur new algorithm builds on more than two decades of research in optical physics in our laboratory and has direct applications in augmented reality, night-time driving, biology, and space exploration,\u201d Jalali said. \u201cComparison of VEViD with leading neural network algorithms shows comparable or better image quality but with one to two orders of magnitude faster-processing speed.\u201d</p><p> The physics-inspired approach leads to a surprisingly simple and computationally efficient algorithm with exceptional image quality and processing speed. The algorithm can enhance 4K-resolution videos at more than 200 frames per second, much faster than other algorithms with similar image quality.</p><p> Under low-light conditions such as at night time, digital images suffer from low contrast and loss of information. VEViD is designed to improve these qualities for two purposes: increased visual quality for human perception and increased object-detection accuracy using machine learning. The technology has applications in security cameras, autonomous vehicles, robots, vision assistance for the elderly and live cell tracking for drug development.</p><p>  The team has successfully demonstrated VEViD\u2019s ability to perform a color enhancement and managed to pair the algorithm with a neural network trained to detect objects. \u201cVEViD can act as a pair of glasses for computer vision algorithms trained on daylight scenes \u2014 allowing them to see and detect objects in the dark,\u201d MacPhee said. \u201cThis makes those networks more robust while also saving training time and energy.\u201d</p><p> The research was supported by grants from the Parker Center for Cancer Immunotherapy and the Office of Naval Research.

To solve this problem, chipmakers decided to rotate the use of transistors, leaving certain areas unused at any given time, the so-called \u201cdark silicon,\u201d but that has created its own problem of inefficiency.  Now, UCLA electrical engineers have designed a new type of computer chip that takes advantage of the increasingly underutilized processing areas. The problem of inefficiency in dark silicon areas has cropped up over the past decade. While transistors have continued to get smaller, the chip\u2019s power consumption has remained the same, leading to power shortages if all the transistors are in use simultaneously. To stay within the power limit, only transistors in certain areas are \u201cturned on\u201d at any one time.

Similar to a pipe that enables liquid to flow through from one end to the other in both directions, standard optical materials and lenses allow light to travel both ways through devices such as a camera. A research team at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering lead by professors Aydogan Ozcan and Mona Jarrahi recently invented a new unidirectional material to break this paradigm in optical imaging. The researchers used artificial intelligence (AI) to structurally engineer materials with details at scales smaller than the wavelength of light. The result is an imager design through which imaging is only possible in one direction, while being blocked from the other. </p><p> Published in Science Advances, the paper titled \u201cUnidirectional Imaging Using Deep Learning-Designed Materials\u201d delineates the innovative optical imager design consisting of a series of transmissive optical layers through the spatial engineering of materials using deep learning. \u201cThis AI-driven engineering of the material leads to the formation of multiple structured, transparent layers that collectively modulate the optical waves with an asymmetric behavior in the forward and backward imaging directions,\u201d said Aydogan Ozcan, holder of UCLA\u2019s Volgenau Chair for Engineering Innovation. \u201cThe resulting unidirectional imager allows image formation from an input field of view to an output field of view, but not the other way around. The reverse path for image formation is blocked.\u201d</p><p>  Even under broadband light composed of many wavelengths, the unidirectional imager can maintain its functionality despite being trained using a single illumination wavelength. This unidirectional imaging capability is also independent of light polarization and works under any orientation of light oscillations. In their experiments, the researchers successfully demonstrated the design\u2019s efficacy on a 3D-printed multilayered imager by exposing it to terahertz radiation. The team also designed a separate imager that allowed a user to choose which direction the image should be blocked by selecting a specific wavelength. For example, at one wavelength, the image formation only works from left to right, while at a different wavelength, the reversed path is the only direction from which the image can be seen.</p><p>   This wavelength-multiplexed design enhances the unidirectional imager\u2019s capability and flexibility, allowing it to function like a switchboard to control the transmission of information coded in light waves. Unidirectional imagers can operate at any part of the electromagnetic spectrum using different transmissive materials or substrates, and they are very thin \u2014 with a few tens of wavelengths in thickness, which, in the visible spectrum, would correspond to the thickness of a stamp. These unidirectional imagers could have a significant impact on various fields, including security, defense and telecommunications.</p><p>   Funded by the Office of Naval Research and Burroughs Wellcome Fund, the study was conducted in collaboration with professor Mona Jarrahi, holder of UCLA\u2019s Northrop Grumman Endowed Chair.

However, the cost and speed limitations of power converters restrict the flexibility and bandwidth of energy transfer. Moreover, most of the current models, controls, and designs do not align with each other. Models are either too simple to capture the underlying physics or too complicated to be utilized for design, while rigorous control laws result in overly conservative control performance. Much of the practical hardware is rule-based and semi-empirical.</p><p>   My research group focuses on the algorithm and hardware that transform power-electronics-based energy systems, from those as small as power conversion circuits to those as large as interconnected microgrids, from those as fast as electromagnetic transients to those as slow as electrochemical dynamics. Currently, we are working on projects including high-speed high-frequency power converters for information & data systems, power management of second-life battery energy storage systems, nonlinear control and transient stability of microgrids, and distributed energy generation & integration. Our ultimate research goal is to bridge the fundamental theory and emerging applications of power-electronics-dominated energy systems by innovating control-aware modeling frameworks, high-performance hardware validations, provably-correct control policies, and physics-informed learning schemes. </p><p>   Xiaofan Cui is an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Every year, IEEE at UCLA hosts over 100 events, encompassing technical lectures, community outreach, professional development, socials, industry workshops, and IDEA Hacks, one of the largest hardware hackathons in the nation. Additionally, we lead several projects for our members to participate in, where dedicated leads provide fundamental knowledge and skills to students to help them complete challenging and interesting projects. Currently, members can choose between 5 diverse projects: <span>OPS, Micromouse, Aircopter, DAV,</span> and <span>WRAP.</span> Additionally, we hold workshops throughout the year that members are free to drop in on and attend. </p><p> Our <span>OPS</span> program is designed to provide hands-on foundational knowledge in the field of tech and hardware. We assume you know absolutely nothing, and build your knowledge from the ground up. Throughout the year, students will be challenged to complete 3-4 small projects per quarter by applying the skills they have learned. </p><p> A <span> micromouse</span> is a small robot that is programmed to find its way to a goal within a maze. In this program, our leads teach you the fundamentals of how a micromouse is designed, and eventually you will print your own PCB, solder a micromouse together, and program it through a maze. We hold annual events where students are invited to compete against each other with their micromouses. </p><p> Our <span>Aircopter </span>program is designed around a few projects that require more advanced topics not covered in our beginning OPS program. Some of the subjects we emphasize in this program are communication, advanced control, motors, and common modules such as gyroscopes and radio modules to build a quadcopter. </p><p>The <span>Digital Audio Visualizer</span> project, or <span>DAV,</span> is designed to give students a new learning experience with hardware design for digital logic circuits. Students will build a real-life application of signal processing by using an FPGA to calculate Fourier Transforms from microphone audio, and displaying the frequency information on a monitor. </p><p> The <span>Wireless, RF, and Analog Project,</span> or <span>WRAP,</span> is an opportunity for students to dive into analog circuits and wireless communications, beyond what is covered in classes. Over the course of the school year, students will learn the fundamentals of analog and RF circuits, and digital communications. Using this knowledge, students will design, simulate, and fabricate from scratch their own wireless transmitter and receiver system. </p><p> IEEE also holds a series of workshops throughout the school year where anyone can participate and learn about new skills and technologies. These workshops are aimed at teaching everyone about common skills in electrical engineering such as soldering, image processing, prototyping, and electronics.

Major research efforts are ongoing for the synthesis and design of advanced materials, such as two-\xaddimensional semiconductors, topological insulators, and \xadmagnetic oxides \u2014 both their fundamental properties and their applications to ultra-scaled logic and memory devices. We also have extensive activities in the \xaddesign and fabrication of ultra-scaled devices on both silicon and compound semiconductors, such as power and RF transistors, spin-based switches and memory elements, tunnel FETs, and other novel devices that are \xadsuitable for applications that go beyond conventional scaling. \xadAnother major thrust is the development of \xadneuromorphic (i.e., brain-\xadinspired) devices and nanosystems for computation and \xadinformation processing. Nanoelectronic devices are under \xadinvestigation for use as sensors for compact biomedical sensing tools. This area also includes the development of Micro- and Nano-Electromechanical Systems (MEMS and NEMS). In \xadaddition, we investigate new methods of interconnecting \xadheterogeneous devices for a more holistic interpretation of Moore\u2019s law. Many of these research activities take place in \xadcollaboration with other \xadresearch groups, both within and \xadoutside ECE, on circuit/system/device co-design and \xadco-\xadoptimization.

For example, nearly all of the information on the internet is transported by encoding it onto signals of infrared light carried on optical fibers. Many unknown materials can be identified by studying how light interacts with them (i.e., by scattering, absorbing, phase shifting, or polarizing some incident photons). The name \u201cphotonics\u201d emphasizes the importance of quantum mechanical properties of light and its interaction with matter. Many topics in photonics research involve development and/or use of lasers. Our research program encompasses topics such as how light interacts both with matter on the nanoscale and in plasmas, as well as new ways to generate, detect, and control light in underdeveloped spectral regions. Applications under investigation include the diverse topics of solar energy generation, lensless microscopy for cell-phone based telemedicine, high energy laser wakefield particle accelerators, ultra-high frame rate imaging, silicon photonics, biomedical imaging, and use of stabilized lasers for ultra-high precision measurements \u2014 just to name a few.</p></div></div><div class="full"><div class="prof-pics"><div><img class="fac" src="/img/Arisaka_Katsushi.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty  Arisaka_Katsushi"></div><div><img class="fac" src="/img/SergioCarbajo.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty  Sergio Carbajo"></div><div><img class="fac" src="/img/Jia-Ming-Liu.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty  Jia-Ming-Liu"></div><div><img class="fac" src="/img/Ozcan_Aydogan.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty Ozcan"></div><div><img class="fac" src="/img/williams.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty  Ben Williams"></div><div><img class="fac" src="/img/fetterman.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty Harold Fetterman"></div><div><img class="fac" src="/img/PATEL-emeritus.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty Patel"></div><div><img class="fac" src="/img/stafsudd.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Faculty  Stafsudd"></div></div><div class="page-caption faculty-caption"><b>Faculty:</b>Katsushi Arisaka, Sergio Carbajo, Jia-Ming Liu, Aydogan Ozcan, Benjamin Williams (pictured).
